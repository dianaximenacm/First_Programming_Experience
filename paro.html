	<h1 class="j2">I'll never forget my first flight !</h1>
		
	<p> While I was involve in the creation of this project, a lot of events were happening around me, this make me think about the importance of  learning enviroments and the adaptability that a committed person should have.  </p>

	<p> Also  makes me remember the Behaviour learning theory and the application that could have in the process of learning the basic programming concepts, which are necessary for creating this kind of web pages. </p>

	<img id="smart_thumbnail" class="small" src="https://www.mbatuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Types-Of-Learning.-final-696x936.png" alt="Types of learning"/>


	 <h2 class="j2"> It does not compile </h2>

	     <p>One of the many different ways in which people can learn is through a process known as operant conditioning (also known as instrumental conditioning)
	       This involves learning through reinforcement or punishment. The type of reinforcement used can play an important role in how quickly a behavior is learn               ed and the overall strength of the resulting response.</p>

	     <p> In this case every time that the code do not work as we want, it coulbe the punishment, but when we get the visible result of a tailor-made code, this              is absolutely the greatest reinforcement that we can obtain.</p>

       
	 <h2 id="j2" >FeedBack </h2>
		    
	     <p>  Feedback refers to the after effect of behavior an act. It is also necessary in this process and the name of this feedback until know for me is : 
	       <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">the markup validation service</a>.</p>
	     
 
	  <h2 class="j2"> 3 is better than 1 </h2>
        
	     <p>Both children & adults learn a great through observation. Young children learn languages, social skills, habits, ears& much other everyday behavior by               observing their parents& older children. Observational learning helps people to acquire new behavior in two ways</p>

	     <p> In the Learning through Observation my best tool in this process is my great friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube</a>.</p>
	     

	  <h3 class="j2" >Learning Through Experience</h3>
	     
	 <p> It involves the forming of new associations & the perceiving of new relationships among event.
	   This type of learning is called cognitive because it refers to the processing of information about the environment that is received through senses.
	   Cognitive processes involve. 
        </p>
	      <p> I believe that this is the missing step in a road that never ends, you are always learning , always moving , particularly in constant changing worls as is the programming.
